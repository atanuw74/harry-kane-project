The Three Lions captain - Harry Kane, had a fantastic 2020/21 campaign in the Premier League. He was involved in 37 goals for his team in 35 appearances. He was linked to Man City in this summer window but the move fell through. But as things stand, he still might be open to leaving Tottenham for a new challenge.

Here I've tried to find the possible alternatives (based on last season's stats) to Harry Kane at: 

-> Tottenham Hotspur if they sell him in the upcoming transfer window. 

-> Any other club who missed out or might miss out on signing him. 

The analysis is based on the Per 90 stats of top performers of the Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1 from 2020/21 season: Goals Per 90, Assists Per 90, Shots Per 90, Key Passes Per 90, xG Per 90, xA Per 90, npg Per 90 (non penalty goals per 90), npxG Per 90, xGChain Per 90, xGBuildup Per 90


SHORT TERM ALTERNATIVE: 

Luis Muriel from Atalanta B.C. 

The forward was the 3rd highest goal scorer in the Serie A last season with 22 goals to his name. 
And in my opinion, he's the best alternative to Harry Kane & the stats don't lie. But at 30 years old, he is only a short term alternative


LONG TERM ALTERNATIVES: 

1. Lautaro Martinez from Inter Milan 

The 24 year-old forward has been at Inter since 2018 and has been putting in good performances during his tenure there. Last season in the Serie A, he had 27 goal involvements. 
Still only 24, he's nowhere near his best yet. 

2. Kelechi Iheanacho from Leicester City

I feel that Iheanacho has often been in Jamie Vardy's shadow but last season he made a name for himself in that Leicester attack. Didn't have the best start to the season but picked up his from in March 2021 and was unstoppable. 
Based on stats, he isn't far behind Kane. The only area where he lacks in comparison to Kane is Assists Per 90 but let's be honest, Kane surprised everyone with his assists record last season. 

SPECIAL MENTIONS: 
1. Mauro Icardi from PSG (Age: 28)

2. Gerard Moreno from Villarreal (Age: 29)
